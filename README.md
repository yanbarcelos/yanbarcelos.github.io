### Projects

#### [Classification of Obesity Levels](https://github.com/yanbarcelos/classification-obesity-levels)

This project aims to classify obesity levels and identify the key lifestyle and physical factors that contribute to them. Using a dataset of self-reported lifestyle habits, this analysis provides insights into the relationships among diet, physical activity and various obesity classifications.

Initial analysis was conducted to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, providing a foundational understanding of the key features. Next, features were processed and engineered for optimal model performance. A random forest classifier was selected as the primary model. To optimize its performance and prevent overfitting, hyperparameter tuning was performed using randomized search CV. The final model's feature importance scores were analyzed to identify the most influential factors in predicting obesity levels, offering valuable insights for public health initiatives.

The final classifier achieved exceptional performance, demonstrating its robustness with 98% accuracy and a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.98 across all obesity categories. The feature importance analysis revealed that, besides BMI, gender and number of daily meals were the strongest predictors of obesity.

#### [Marketing Analytics](https://github.com/yanbarcelos/marketing-analytics)

An online retail business was experiencing a decline in key performance indicators (KPIs) despite a significant marketing investment. The business needed to understand the root causes of reduced customer engagement and conversion rates to optimize its marketing strategy and improve return on investment.

I began by exploring transactional and customer feedback data to establish a baseline for key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Conversion Rate, Customer Engagement Rate, and Average Order Value (AOV). This analysis helped pinpoint the specific areas of decline and the extent of the problem. To understand the "why" behind the reduced engagement, I performed sentiment analysis on customer feedback. I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the key metrics and insights. This dashboard provides a clear overview of the campaign's performance, customer behavior trends, and the impact of the identified issues on the business. It serves as a tool for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
